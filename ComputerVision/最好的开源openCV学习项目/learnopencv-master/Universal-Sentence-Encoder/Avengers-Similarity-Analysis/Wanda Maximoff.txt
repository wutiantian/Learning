Vis? Is it the stone again?
What does it say?
I just feel you.
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
There is an 11.
You gave Stark your word.
There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.
It works.
What are they?
No, Vision. Vision, if that's trueâ€¦ Then maybe going isn't the best idea.
Vision!
Is that even possible?
Vis!
Hands off.
Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.
You asked me to stay... I'm staying.
Get up.
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
And they can clearly find us.
And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.
That's too high a price.
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
Can you do it?
I will.
On my way.
Are you okay?  What? What is it?
No.
Don't.
I can't.
It's not fair.
You could never.
NO!
