Seriously? You don't have any money?
I'll tell the guys at the deli. Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.
Dollars?
Which is?
What do you want?
... Who?
Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.
We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.
Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.
Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
No can do.
Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
A bit chalky.
Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
Well, if we don't do our jobs.
Protecting your reality, douchebag.
Who could find Vision, then?
Oh, great.
... Not at the moment, no.
Might wanna use it.
Certainly not. I speak for myself. But youâ€™re trespassing in this city and on this planet.
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...
It stays with me.
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.
We've gotta turn this ship around.
No, I want to protect the stone.
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. What is he, your ward?
Doctor Strange.
Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?
Can you get us home?
Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
Alright , Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.
I think we're here.
She's right. You can't.
Wait, what, Thanos?  All right, let me ask you this one time. What master do you serve?
Where is he now?
I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
14,000,605.
One.
Oh, yeah. You're much more of a Thanos.
You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Let me guess. Your home?
Genocide.
Congratulations. You're a prophet.
Who wants to murder trillions.
And then what?
I think... you'll find... our wil...l equal to yours.
Do not let him close his fist.
No!
Stop!  Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.
We're in the endgame now.
Tony, there was no other way.
