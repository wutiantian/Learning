Sing it, Drax!
'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.
Which isn't the point... I mean… If he doesn't pony up…
B-b-b-bingo!
All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again.
Groot.
Whoa!
You got some acorns on you, kid.
How the hell is this dude still alive?
I'm muscular.
Yeah, right.
What? Gamora, do you think I'm…
Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
Stop massaging his muscles.   Wake him up.
Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do.
And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-"
What are you doing?
No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.
No.
No I'm not.
This is my voice!
Are you mocking me?
He's trying to copy me.
No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food.
If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.
The Avengers?
Except for that I'm the captain.
That's my backpack.
Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-
Yeah, sure.
Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?
What?
What do you know?
If it's so important, shouldn't I?
Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
I mean, I'd like to. I really would…
Okay.
Dude! How long have you been standing there?
An hour? Are you serious?
You're eating a zarg-nut.
Mmm, no.
This place looks deserted.
Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.
Drax. Drax.
Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.
Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!
That was quick.
Let her go, Grimace!
I told you to go right.
You let her go!
I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.
Or I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face!
I told you to go right.
I love you, too.
Stay down, clown.
Everybody stay where you are. Chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?
Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French fry this little freak.
Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.
What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? "Jesus"?
I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
With Thanos? No, I'm here to kill Thanos. He took my girl. Wait, who are you?
Oh.
Yeah. Tall guy, not the good-looking, needed saving.
The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.
Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good.
It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.
Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.
How many did you see?
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.
Boom!
I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?
No, bullshit. Where is she?
Good.
...What?
Tell me she's lying.  ASSHOLE! TELL ME YOU DIDN'T DO IT!!!
No, you didn't… No, you didn't…   NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!

Where is he?!
Did we just lose?
Aw, man.
