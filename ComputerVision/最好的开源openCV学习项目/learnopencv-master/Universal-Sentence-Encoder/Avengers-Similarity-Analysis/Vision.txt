It's as if it's speaking to me.
I don't... I don't know. But something...
Tell me what you feel.
What if I miss that train?
What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?
I'd rather give it to you.
Not to each other.  Wanda… For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. - I, I... I think...
It works.
Then stay. Stay with me.
Or not. If I'm overstepping…
What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.
Wanda, I…
The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.
Please. Please leave.
Please.
Thank you, Captain.
No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… Its molecular integrity could fail.
Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?
It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
We don't trade lives, Captain.
He's here.
Wanda. It's time.
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.
You must do it. Wanda, please. We are out of time.
Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.
It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just feel you.
It's all right. It's all right. I love you.
