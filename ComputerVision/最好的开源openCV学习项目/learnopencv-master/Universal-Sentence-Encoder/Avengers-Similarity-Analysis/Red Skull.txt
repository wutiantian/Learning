A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.
What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.
In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.
They're not for him.
