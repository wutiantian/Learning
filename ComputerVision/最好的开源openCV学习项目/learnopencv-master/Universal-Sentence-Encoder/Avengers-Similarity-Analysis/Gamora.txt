It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.
Which isn't the point.
Hey!
It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal  To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre...
If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this.
Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
Thor… Why would he go to Knowhere?
How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.
I need to ask a favor.
One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.
If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.
I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… The entire Universe could be at risk.
If I tell you, you'd know, too.
Only if you wanna die.
Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.
Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
You knew I'd come.
Peter…
Now? Really?
Peter…
Not him.
You promised! You promised.
I love you, more than anything.
I always hated that chair.
I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
I was a child when you took me.
No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
Because you murdered half the planet.
You're insane.
You don't know that!
I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Nebula.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.
Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.
All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.
Really? Tears?
No. This isn't love.
No!
Did you do it?
What did it cost?
