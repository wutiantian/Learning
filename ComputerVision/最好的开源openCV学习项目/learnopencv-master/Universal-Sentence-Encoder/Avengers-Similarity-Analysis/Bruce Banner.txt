Thanos is coming. He's coming...
Hey, Tony.
Pepper.
Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York, that's him.
No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...
That's a thing?
Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.
What do you mean?
What? Tony, you lost another super bot?
Call him.
No.
Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?
Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.
Go! Got it!
No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?
I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.
I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.
I know.
Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't-
Damn it.
Where'd that come from?
Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me?  Come out! Come out! Come out!
What do you mean, "no"?!
Where you going?
I'm gonna make a call.
Uh, I think you look great. Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.
Nat.
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?
Who's Scott?
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's stone.
Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.
I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.
Not me. Not here.
Should we bow?
Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.
Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.
Because, we didn't think of it.
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-  I'm okay. I'm okay.
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision.
There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!
AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!
I got him!
Ohh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-
Guys! Vision needs backup now!   Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.  Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!  Come on!
See ya!  Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.
Cap. That's him.
