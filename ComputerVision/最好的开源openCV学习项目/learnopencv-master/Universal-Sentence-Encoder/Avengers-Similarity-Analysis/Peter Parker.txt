Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?
Field trip to MoMA.
What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?
On it!
Not cool!
Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!
But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!
Yeah! That makes sense.
Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!
Oh, come on!
Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus.
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...
I know what you're gonna say.
I was gonna go home-
But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-
...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.
I take that back. And now I'm here in space.
No. I did think this through.
It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.
Um. Okay, okay...uh....  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?
Yes! Wait what are those!
Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.
I'm backup.
No. I'm Peter, by the way.
Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.
Hey, what's going on?
Yep, got it.
Okay. Okay. Ready.
We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!
Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I end up eating you, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to say that something is coming.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!
So, you're not with Thanos?
We're the Avengers, man.
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?
Like in Footloose, the movie?
It never was.
Okay.
Hey, what was that?
Magic!  More magic!  Magic with a kick!  Magic with a-
It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!  I got it! I got it...!
Oh, God.
I got you! I got you!  I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names!
Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...
I don't know what's- I don't know what's happening. I don't-  Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry.
