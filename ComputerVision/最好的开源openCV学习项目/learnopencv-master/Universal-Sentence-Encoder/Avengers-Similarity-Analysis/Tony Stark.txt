Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.
No, I'm not.
Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?
Okay, and then you're like, "Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?" "Oh! Someone's watching." "I'm gonna go in my pants."
Yes.
Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?
Morgan! Morgan.
Expecting.
Yes?
I had a dream about it. It was so real.
I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.
No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-
I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...
You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
I will.
I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?
And who's "we"?
Bruce.
You okay?
Tell me his name again.
This is it. What's our timeline?
Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?
Is that what this is...?
I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?
And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...
It's not bad.
Whatever. Point is  Things change.
And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.
What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?
Yeah, that's the... thing.
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.
I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
Shit.  Probably Steve Rogers.
Maybe. But... sighs
It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?
You okay?
Help him! Wong, Doc.
F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?
Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.
It means get lost, Squidward!
Banner, you want a piece?
That's right.
Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.
Where's your guy?
There's no time for a thing.
That's the thing right there. Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-
Gotta get that stone outta here, now.
Exactly. Bye.
Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
Hammer.
Kid, where'd you come from?
He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
Hang on, kid.
Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.
You're too high up. You're running out of air.
Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8 30 res.
Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.
Yeah.
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
Pepâ€¦
Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?
What the-
You should not be here.
I don't wanna hear it.
And now I gotta hear it.
What did you just say?
Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
You could not have possibly thought this through.
Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.
Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.
No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.
This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
Yeah?
Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.
No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?
Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.
You alright?   That was close. I owe you one.
I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?
Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!
You're from Earth?
Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?
You know Thor?
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.
Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.
Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?
We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....
What dance-off?
Don't encourage this, alright?
We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
Your math is blowing my mind.
Strange, we alright?
You're back. You're alright.
How many did we win?
Piece of cake, Quill.
Is he under? Don't let up.
Parker, help! Get over here.  She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?
Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!
You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.
You know me?
My only curse is you.
Don't..!
Why would you do that?
Steady, Quill.
You're all right.
