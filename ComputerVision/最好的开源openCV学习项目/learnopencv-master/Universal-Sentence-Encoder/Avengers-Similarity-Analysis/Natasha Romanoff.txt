We don't wanna kill you. But we will.
I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.
You could use some of that right now.
Hi, Bruce.
After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.
Well then, we have to protect it.
Can we do that?
How we looking?
Vision, get your ass back on the table.
How we looking, Bruce?
Where's your other friend?
Looks like we pissed her off.
She's not alone.
That was really gross.
What the hell?
