And the Border Tribe?
Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.
This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.
On its way.
And what did you imagine?
Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?
You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...
We will hold them off.
Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.
Thank you for standing with us.
You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
We open the barrier.  On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.
On my signal.
WAKANDA FOREVER!  Now!
How much longer, Shuri?
You might want to pick up the pace.
Fall back! Fall back now!
Up, General. Up! This is no place to die.
