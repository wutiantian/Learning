Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...  for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.
Let him have his fun.
Shhh.
My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.
Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...
Stonekeeper... Does this chattering animal speak for you?
He exhausts me.
Bring me the Stone.
Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
Then I'll take it off your corpse.
You'll only wish you were dead.  NO!
Zehobereians…
Choose a side, or die.
One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.
Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.
In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. [the needles start to contact Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch[ Give me... the stone.
Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...
...could end your friend's life in an instant.
You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
