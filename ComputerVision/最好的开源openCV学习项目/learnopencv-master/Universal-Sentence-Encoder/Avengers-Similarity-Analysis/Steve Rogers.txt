Let's get you on the jet.
Home.
Mr. Secretary.
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.
You too, Rhodey.
Ant-Man.
But it should. We don't trade lives, Vision.
I know somewhere.
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.
Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.
How you been, Buck?
How long?
Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.
That's not gonna happen.
Not exactly.

New haircut?
I am Steve Rogers.
Somebody get to Vision!
Get outta here!  Go!
I thought I told you to go.
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.
Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?
.... Oh, God.
