I assure you, brother, the sun will shine on us again.
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk.
If I might interjectâ€¦ If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.
I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard...  Odinson... The rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.
You will... never be... a god.
